        "first_paragraph": "UNITE is a Public Procurement Platform exclusively for governmental procurement of special orders of products and services for crisis response. \nWe call it \"The Alibaba of urgent public procurement requests.\"\n\n UNITE is a two-sided platform, connecting public buyers with companies that have the capability and capacity to refocus their activities to supplying goods and services in response to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n Companies are invited to register on the platform, describing their capability and capacity to manufacture urgently needed products or to supply in-demand services. \nCompanies can also browse and respond to open tender requests placed by public buyers. \n\n  Public buyers can access the platform and create a procurement request. Our software matches the procurement request with potential suppliers and facilitates the complete transaction - including initial contact, negotiation. order placement, delivery acceptance, and payment.",
        "second_paragraph": "UNITE differentiates itself from other solutions in that it provides a database of companies with capability to refocus operations and in that it automates the process. Other solutions include using existing suppliers and ERP\/purchasing system (not suited to abnormal requirements); engagement with the market through contacting individual companies by email, telephone or in person (which is slow); use of other online sales platforms (no visibility of the ability of companies to refocus operations); own knowledge of public buyers and their connections to industry (not widely shared - limited to individuals or local teams).",
